# PvZ2C bypass binding limit patch
This is a repo for apks of PvZ2C from different providers with bypass binding limit patch built-in. To download patch, navigate to [releases](https://github.com/CyberSteve777/pvz2c_bypass_binding_limit_patch/releases) page.

For base game download mirror, visit [this](https://github.com/Archiver2c/pvz2c-mirror/releases) repository.

Notes: 
- You have to delete your current instance of the game before installing these apks, and it will count towards binding 4 devices per year. However, future updates won't increase counter, if updating from previous version by me.
- Currently it works only with 64 bit devices, the patch doesn't apply to 32 bit devices.

Have a great day!
